## Null Pointers


### Overview

Prior to C++11, C++ was using a tweaked version of the C idiom of relying on the define `NULL` to represent the null pointer. In C++ `NULL` is typically defined as `0`, which means that an expression such as `int a = NULL` is perfectly valid in C++03.

To rectify this awkward situation, C++11 introduced a new keyword, `nullptr`, to finally give the language a well defined meaning of null that doesn't rely on an external library.

### The nullptr pointer literal

`nullptr` is special because aside from being a keyword it's also a literal constant with its own type.
This is significant because of its greater implications on interacting with the `nullptr` literal.
(The type of `nullptr` is often referred to as `std::nullptr_t`, but I will be referring to it as `nullptr_t` (without the `std` namespace) because its type can be inferred without using the stdlib, a process which shall be explained in the `Type Inference` section.)

Firstly `nullptr_t` can have its own set of rules as to what types it's allowed to be cast to.
`nullptr_` is implicitly convertible to the null pointer value of any pointer type, and any pointer to member type.

Secondly, as `nullptr_t` is its own type, it can be used in function overloads to detect when the `nullptr` literal is being used as an argument type, and respond accordingly – typically by omitting code or creating a compile time error (the typical mechanism for doing so, `static_cast`, will be discussed later).

For example:

```
void function(void * p)
{
	// Print pointer in hexadecimal
	std::cout << std::hex << reinterpret_cast<int>(p) << '\n';
}

void function(std::nullptr_t)
{
	// Print word “nullptr”
	std::cout << “nullptr” << '\n';
}

int main(void)
{
	int a = 0;
	function(&a); // Prints address of a in hexadecimal
	function(nullptr); // Prints “nullptr”

	int * b = &a;
	function(b); // Prints address of a in hexadecimal

	int * c = nullptr;
	function(c); // Prints 0 in hexadecimal
}
```

Furthermore, the following is a compilation error:
```
int main(void)
{
	int a = nullptr; // compiler error due to type mismatch
}
```

However, the following is permitted:
```
int main(void)
{
	int a = reinterpret_cast<int>(nullptr); // allowed, a becomes 0
}
```

Note that many implementations of `NULL` have been redefined as `nullptr` to make the formerly legal action of `int a = NULL;` a compiler error.


## Type Aliases

### Overview

A type alias is an identifier that can be used as an alias for another type – i.e. the alias and the original type name are interchangeable.

### Type aliases defined with typedef

Traditionally this is done with `typedef`, where the type name comes first and the alias comes afterwards, for example the statement `typedef int Index;` creates the type alias `Index` which is equivalent to `int` such that `Index a = 1 + 1;`.

To further illustrate, consider the following code, which prints “int: 2” to stdout because `Index` is synonymous with `int`, thus the overload for `int` is called.
```
void print(int i)
{
	std::cout << “int: “ <<  i << '\n';
}

void print(char c)
{
	std::cout << “char: “ << c << '\n';
}

void print(bool b)
{
	std::cout << “bool: “ << (b ? “true” : “false”) << '\n';
}

typedef int Index;

int main(void)
{    
	Index a = 1 + 1;
	print(a);
	return 0;
}
```

In C++11 there is a newer, more intuitive way of assigning a type alias by using the `using` keyword. (Note that the keyword `using` already existed in the language prior to C++ and has other uses in other contexts. C++11 added a new usage to an existing keyword.)

### Type aliases defined with using

The `using` keyword can be used to declare a type alias as thus: `using Index = int;`, which is equivalent to the earlier example of `typedef int Index;`. `using` is now preferred to `typedef` for several reasons.
Firstly the equals sign acts as a separator to make it clear where the alias ends and the original type name begins.
Secondly the ordering of the alias and the original type match the order in which variables are declared as opposed to the 'backwards' way used by `typedef`.
And thirdly it allows for another use case that will be discussed later in the 'Hard' section because of its relationship to templates.


## Type Inference


### Overview

Type inference is the process of inferring a type from an expression.
If the individual parts of an expression have enough type information present, the type of an expression can be inferred from its contents.

For example, an integer literal is of type `int`, and the operator `+` with two `int` operands returns an `int`, so the type of the expression `1 + 1` can be inferred to be `int`. The same principles can be applied to functions rather than operators and variables rather than constants, thus permitting the inference of the majority of expressions.
(The idea that an integer literal is of type `int` is an oversimplification for ease of explanation, see `Note` section for more details.)

C++11 mandates that type inference be included in the compiler implementation in order to facilitate two new language features, `auto` and `decltype`.

### The auto specifier

`auto` is used to allow a variable to infer its type from its assigning expression.
For example the statement `auto i = 1 + 1;` infers the type of `i` to be `int`.

`auto` can also include `const`, `*` and `&` to infer constant values, pointers and references.
For example `const auto & a = b;` makes `a` a const reference to `b` whilst correctly inferring the type. Thus if the type of `b` is changed at compile time, the type of `a` will update automatically because it is inferred rather than explicitly specified.

### The decltype specifier

`decltype` also offers the power of type inference, but has a different use case.
An expression of `decltype(e)` where `e` represents the type of `e`.
In other words `decltype(0)` evaluates as the type `int` and can be used in place of `int` anywhere where a type is expected, such as when creating type aliases or declaring variables.
For example, `using Index = decltype(0);` will create a type alias `Index` that has the type of `int` because `int` is the type of the integer literal `0`.

`decltype` can handle complex expressions, such as `decltype((1 + 1) / static_cast<float>(2) * 2.0)`, which evaluates to `double` because `2.0` is a floating point literal of type `double` supersedes the `int` and `float` values due to floating point promotion as a result of implicit conversion rules.

### The type of nullptr

The type of `nullptr` is not representable with a single keyword.
However, due to the `decltype` mechanism, it is possible to create a type alias for the type of `nullptr`, which is how `std::nullptr_t` is typically implemented.
Specifically `std::nullptr_t` is typically defined as either `typedef decltype(nullptr) nullptr_t;` or `using nullptr_t = decltype(nullptr);` within stdlib implementations.
A similar approach is sometimes used for `std::size_t` where an expression similar to `using size_t = sizeof(0);` is sometimes used.

### Final word

While all this may seem powerful and useful, I urge caution where possible.
`auto` makes writing code easier, but it can also make code harder to read when the inferred type isn't easy to figure out or is important to know, hence `auto` is best kept to cases where the type of an expression is obvious, where the type has a long name, where the type would be repeated (e.g. taking the result of a constructor or cast), or with templates where the inferred type might vary or is less important.

### Note

Stating that an integer literal is of type `int` is an oversimplification for the sake of keeping the explanation short and easy. In truth there are rules about what type an integer literal is, which depend on the actual size of `int`, which may be anything from 16 bits to 64 bits on most systems. As a rule of thumb, an integer literal takes the smallest type equal to or larger than `int` in which it can fit. Which is to say it will never be of type `char` or `short int`, but may be of type `int`, `long int` or `long long int`.


## Static Assertions

### Overview

Sometimes it's useful to be able to verify a fact at compile time and refuse to compile code if that fact isn't true. Prior to C++11 this was possible only through complex, arcane and unintended uses of the template system (one of the reasons the template system is sometimes criticised). The C++ standards authority recognised this and came up with a way to make such checks standardised and not reliant on obscure template code – that way is the `static_assert` declaration.

### The static_assert declaration

`static_assert` is fairly straightforward to use as its syntax is similar to a two-argument function where the first argument is a boolean expression and the second argument is a string constant.
The first argument must evaluate to `true`, otherwise the code will not compile – the compiler will raise an error.
The second argument is the message that is provided alongside the error to give a human readable description of what the error means.

For example the code `static_assert(1 > 5, “One is not greater than five.”);` would stop the code compiling with an error in the error log including the provided message.

Static assertions may appear within a function, within a class or even at global scope.
This means there are many situations where they can be applied.
Typically they are most useful when used with template classes and verifying facts about types.

## Scoped Enumerations

### Overview

Enumerations are a C++ language feature that allow numeric values to be easily assigned named identifiers. They are intended as a replacement for the old-fashioned C method of defining a macro corresponding to a value.

Typically enumerations are intended for fixed sets of values that may or may not be dependant on the number that they're assigned to. (An example of a case where the underlying values are important would be when using an enumeration as a bitset.) The days of the week or months of the year are often given as a common example of an enumeration that isn't reliant on its representation (though this example is uncommon in practice).
Such an example may be given as:
```
enum Weekdays
{
	Monday = 0,
	Tuesday = 1,
	Wednesday = 2,
	Thursday = 3,
	Friday = 4,
	Saturday = 5,
	Sunday = 6
};
```

In this case as the numbers are sequential and start from zero, they can be omitted to achieve the same result:
```
enum Weekdays
{
	Monday,
	Tuesday,
	Wednesday,
	Thursday,
	Friday,
	Saturday,
	Sunday
};
```

Personally I don't find this example very realistic, but it's good for illustrating the concept.
However, these kind of enumerations have a fatal flaw: they are 'unscoped', which is to say the names declared in the enumeration exist at the scope they are declared in. In the simple `Weekdays` example, if `Weekdays` was defined at global scope (i.e. not inside a namespace or class) then all the values it defined would pollute the global scope and prevent any of those names being used elsewhere (e.g. you could no longer use `Monday` as an identifier).

In some cases that's not an issue because enumeration values have very specific names, but in other cases it is catastrophic. Many enumerations typically have a concept of `None` or `Unknown` as one of their values, which can quickly cause a conflict. The old fashioned remedy to this was to either enclose an enumeration in a namespace (which for the most part worked well), or use the old-fashioned C-style approach of prefixing enumeration names with the name of the enumeration type itself. In the `Weekdays` example this would look like:
```
enum Weekdays
{
	Weekdays_Monday,
	Weekdays_Tuesday,
	Weekdays_Wednesday,
	Weekdays_Thursday,
	Weekdays_Friday,
	Weekdays_Saturday,
	Weekdays_Sunday
};
```

Lastly, the issue with traditional unscoped enumerations is that they are implicitly convertible to `int`, which permits the writing of confusing code like `int a = Monday + Sunday + Tuesday;`. Aside from being confusing, this is a worrying violation of type-safety and it leaks details about the underlying values which in many cases are thought of as arbitrary.

The standards committee came up with a solution to all these issues with what is officially termed scoped enumerations (though they are often referred to colloqially as `enum class`es after their syntax).

### Scoped Enumerations

The newly introduced scoped enumerations fix the aforementioned issues with unscoped enumerations.

Firstly, they are strongly typed – they cannot be implicitly converted to `int`.
They can be explicitly converted to `int` using a `static_cast` if need be, but such cases are very specific. Secondly, they are scoped – the type name acts as its own implicit namespace.

Here is the `Weekdays` example as a scoped enumeration:

```
enum class Weekdays
{
	Monday,
	Tuesday,
	Wednesday,
	Thursday,
	Friday,
	Saturday,
	Sunday
};
```

An assignment expression using this new scoped enumeration would look like so: `Weekdays weekday = Weekdays::Monday;`.
Furthermore, the following code is now invalid: `int a = Weekdays::Monday;`

### Operating On Scoped Enumerations

I suspect there are some of you who recognise that treating enumerations as numbers can indeed be handy in certain situations. You are right. But worry not, the capabilities of unscoped enumerations are not lost. In fact the new situation is better, because it follows C++'s mantra of giving the programmer full control.

With scoped enumerations, it is completely possible to define custom non-member operators for them. For example, if you wish to define an increment operator, you can do so.
Here's an example of an increment operator for `Weekdays`, with built-in wrap around.
```
Weekdays & operator++(Weekdays & weekday)
{
	if(weekday != Weekday::Sunday)
		weekday = static_cast<Weekday>(static_cast<int>(weekday) + 1);
	else
		weekday = Weekday::Monday;
	return weekday;
}
```

Although this now gives the programmer extra work, it also gives the programmer more control and doesn't sacrifice type-safety to do so. The traditional system of implicit conversion to `int` not only allows bugs to slip in, but it also permits the use of operators that make no sense in context. The new system constrains the operations that can be performed to not only enforce type safety, but also to stop invalid operations from being used.
Compiler-enforced invalidity is many times more reliable than depending on a human to abstain from trying certain operations, and also has the benefit of allowing the programmer to not worry about documenting which operations should not be used since the compiler can now be the one to inform people (in big red letters).

### Final Word

For some reason I can never understand, many people seem to avoid using enumerations (scoped or unscoped). I'm not sure whether it's because they don't know how or because they have some strange misconceptions about enumerations, but either way I'd like to set the record straight.

Enumerations are a good thing. They are not slow, they are just as fast as if you were using bare integers because they do in fact generate the same code as if you had been using bare integers.
However, they have a major advantage over bare integers – they're far more readable.
The main motivation for enumerations is to act as syntactic sugar to make code more readable for humans, which is why they can be found in so many different languages (C, C++, C#, Java (sort of), Haskell, Swift).

Some people like to try to use defines for associating a name with a number.
Doing so is potentially unsafe because there's no type to protect the value from accidental misuse.
They also suffer from the issues of requiring a unique name and having no concept of scope – once they're declared they're accessible to the whole program. In comparison, even simple unscoped enumerations can be placed inside namespaces or even kept private inside a class.

In short, the advantages of scoped enumerations generally outweigh the benefits of other approaches and thus they should be the default choice for sets of named values.

## Enumerations With A Fixed Underlying Type

### Overview

All enumerations are merely syntactic sugar for integer usage. By the time all the code has been compiled, it is as if the code had been written using bare numbers. This means that all enumerations have what is called an 'underlying type' which is always either `bool` or one of the integral integer types. Typically this underlying type matches the processor's natural word size (i.e. it's usually `int`) because doing so often results in faster code, but that isn't always the case.

C++11 added the facility to choose the underlying type of an enumeration (scoped or unscoped) to give the programmer greater control and to give enumerations greater flexibility. This is referred to as 'fixing' the underlying type of an enumeration (i.e. making the underlying type 'fixed' as opposed to 'unfixed' where the underlying type is not obvious).

### Type Fixing

There aren't many reasons to want to fix the underlying type of an enumeration, but reasons do exist. For modern computers, the main reason would be to match up with specific widths of values in file formats or data packets (like the next header field in an IP header).
For embedded systems, sometimes smaller underlying types are used in an attempt to save memory or to match specific data. (One of my favourite examples being an enumeration representing the state of a group of buttons encoded as a bitset.)
A type-fixed enum is declared like so:
```
// std::uint8_t is guaranteed to be 8 bits
enum class Buttons : std::uint8_t
{
  None = 0,
  Up = 1 << 0,
  Down = 1 << 1,
  Left = 1 << 2,
  Right = 1 << 3,
  // Note that the | operator works only during the enum definition
  // Outside of the definition it would have to be manually defined
  All = Up | Down | Left | Right,
};
```

If the type hadn't been fixed then the underlying type would be implementation defined.
By fixing the type, a value of type `Buttons` is guaranteed to be the same size as the declared type (in this case, 8 bits), which may be useful in certain situations.

## String Literals

String literals take the form of quote marks around a text string.
An unadorned string literal would look something like this: `"hello world"` and would have a type of `const char []`.
However, there are other types of string literals that use prefixes to alter the type.

Prior to C++11 the only other string literal type was the wide string literal,
which has a prefix `L` (i.e. it looks like `L"hello world"`) and a value of type `const wchar_t[]`.

As of C++11 there are 4 more types.

* UTF-8 encoded literals, of the form `u8"..."` and of type `const char[]`
* UTF-16 encoded literals, of the form `u"..."` and of type `const char16_t[]`
* UTF-32 encoded literals, of the form `U"..."` and of type `const char32_t[]`

And finally the raw string literal, which behaves slightly differently.
Rather than affecting the type or encoding of the literal, it merely prevents backslashes being treated as character escapes.
It can be combined with all other literal formats.
Which is to say:

* `R"\t"` gives the string `"\t"`, of type `const char[]`
* `LR"\t"` gives the string `"\t"`, of type `const wchar_t[]`
* `u8R"\t"` gives the string `"\t"`, of type `const char[]`
* `uR"\t"` gives the string `"\t"`, of type `const char16_t[]`
* `UR"\t"` gives the string `"\t"`, of type `const char32_t[]`


## Range Based For Loops

The range-based for loop is an important addition to C++11.
It is similar to C#'s `foreach` and Java's 'enhanced for loop'.

It allows iteration through the contents of any container type.
For a type to be a container type it must either:

* Be an array
* Have a suitable `container.begin()` and `container.end()` member function
* Be a valid argument to `begin(container)` and `end(container)`

The syntax for a ranged for loop is as thus:
```cpp
for(init : range)
{
  body;
}
```
Or:
```cpp
for(init : range)
  body;
```

This can be equivalent to several different depending on which of the three constraints the container type satisfies.

Here is an example based on `std::vector`
```cpp
std::vector container = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
for(const auto & variable : container)
{
  std::cout << variable << '\n';
}
```
Which is equivalent to (as of C++11, but prior to C++17):
```cpp
std::vector container = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
{
	auto && range = container;
	for (auto beginIterator = container.begin(), endIterator = container.end(); beginIterator != endIterator; ++beginIterator)
	{
		const auto & variable = *beginIterator;
		std::cout << variable << '\n';
	}
}
```

If `std::vector` did not have a suitable `begin` or `end` member function then an overload of the free function `begin` and `end` would be selected.
(Note that `begin` and `end` are taken using 'argument dependent lookup', meaning that the `begin` or `end` could be taken from a namespace other than `std`.)
```cpp
std::vector container = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
{
	auto && range = container;
	for (auto beginIterator = begin(container), endIterator = end(container); beginIterator != endIterator; ++beginIterator)
	{
		const auto & variable = *beginIterator;
		std::cout << variable << '\n';
	}
}
```
